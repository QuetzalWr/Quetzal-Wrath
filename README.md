In this richly detailed world, up to four players must work together to survive amidst lush jungles, ancient ruins, and hostile factions. Players manage resources, craft tools, and engage in strategic combat while forging alliances and confronting Spanish conquistadors. Choices and actions shape the narrative, offering a unique experience each time.

Quetzal's Wrath combines themes of redemption, prophecy, and survival, presenting a dynamic story where every decision impacts the fate of the Mayan world.
