Quetzal's Wrath is a thrilling cooperative survival RPG set in 1500 AD, just before the Spanish Conquest. Players take on the role of a respected Mayan, exiled due to betrayal and false accusations. During their journey, they uncover the "Prophecy of Quetzal," which foretells a great upheaval marked by the Feathered Serpent and the arrival of foreign invaders threatening Mayan civilization.

## Accuracy

<div align="center">
I am wanting to make this as accurately as possible, but also adding a few supernatural elements. However I do not plan on making the supernatural elements overpower the main focus of the game, will they be crucial? possibly step in ensuring that. 

With that being said, I have been thoroughly going through every single documented literature to be as faithful as possible towards the Mayans, their beliefs, history, and demise. This could be a replayed game with possible future updates of being procedurally-generated with random events happening at different times than your first playthrough. 

Please bear with me as I and a solo developer, who never made a game before is attempting this as just a fun project all while taking my time with it and enjoying it. I am however a Web Developer of over 20 years with a wide-spectrum of coding knowledge.
